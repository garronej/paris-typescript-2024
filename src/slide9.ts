/*
    Now that TypeScript recognizes the implication of the `isPerson(person)` condition,
    we can use a type-aware assertion function to make our intent even clearer.

    However, this code is still not fully type-safe. Itâ€™s possible to make 
    mistakes within the `isPerson` type guard itself. Custom type guards, 
    while powerful, operate outside of TypeScript's usual type-checking safeguards, 
    meaning TypeScript cannot verify their accuracy or alignment with the actual 
    `Person` type definition.

import { assert } from "tsafe";

    name: string;
    age: number;

    return (
        typeof maybePerson === "object" &&
        maybePerson !== null &&
        "name" in maybePerson &&
        typeof (maybePerson as Person).name === "string" &&
        "age" in maybePerson &&
